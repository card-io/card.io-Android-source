Credit card scanning for Android apps
=====================================

This repository contains everything needed to build the [**card.io**](https://card.io) library for Android.

What it does not yet contain is much in the way of documentation. :crying_cat_face: So please feel free to ask any questions by creating github issues -- we'll gradually build our documentation based on the discussions there.

Note that this is actual production code, which has been iterated upon by multiple developers over several years. If you see something that could benefit from being tidied up, rewritten, or otherwise improved, your Pull Requests will be welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Using card.io
-------------

If you merely wish to incorporate **card.io** within your Android app, simply download the latest official release from https://github.com/card-io/card.io-Android-SDK. That repository includes complete integration instructions and sample code.

Dev Setup
---------

### Prerequisites

- Current version of the Android SDK. (obviously)
- Android NDK. We've tested with r10e. At minimum, the Clang toolchain is required.

### First build

There are a few bugs in the build process, so these steps are required for the first build:

1. clone this repo
2. `$ cd card.io-Android-source`
3. init its `dmz` submodule: `git submodule sync; git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. `$ cp local.properties.example local.properties`
5. Edit `local.properties` with your env (Assuming you've defined `$ANDROID_NDK` correctly, run `$ echo "$ANDROID_NDK" "$ANDROID_SDK"`
6. `$ ./gradlew clean assembleDebug`

#### Hints & tricks.
- See [card.io/src/main/jni](card.io/src/main/jni) for native layer (NDK) discussion.

### Testing

#### Running

1. Connect an Android 18 (or better) device.
2. `$ ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`

You should see the app open and run through some tests.

### Un-official Release

`$ ./gradlew clean :card.io:assembleRelease` Cleans and builds an aar file for distribution.

The [official release process](official-release-process.md) is described separately.
